I've felt previously that it is important to develop a philosophy on how to do consistent, efficient, high quality, honest research. It serves as a reminer to base decisions in a grounding framework and provides comfort in times of uncertainty. It also helps me understand why certain collaborations are more successful and how to build/grow research teams that are energized. This page will serve as my continuously evolving research philosophy.

1. Nobody ever did anything of consequence by themselves, regard collaboration most highly.
1. Precedent should be valued highly, it let’s you save time by skipping all the necessary steps to validate something will work if someone has already shown it.
1. Hone judgement to the point where attempts/success ratio is high. This is what research maturity is to me.
1. How to build better judgement: try things only after you’ve convinced yourself the idea has a high probability of working. This encourages reading, reflecting and exploratory experimentation before doing.
1. Don’t protect your ideas like they’re the last great ones you’ll have, trust that they’re not. Be generous with information exchange.
