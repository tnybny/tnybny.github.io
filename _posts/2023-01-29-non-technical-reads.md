As I grow in maturity and have started taking on more responsibility in my roles, I realize that I'm starting to digest a lot of non-technical content that informs my views and beliefs. To complement my [technical reading post](https://tnybny.github.io/posts/2020/11/What-I-read/), this is a list of non-technical reading that has shaped me. It isn't necessarily in a particular order, and while I'll add to it in reverse chronological order, they are all timeless reads as far as I'm concerned. The topics revolve around philosophy, management, organization, leadership, productivity, customer development, marketing, etc.

- Slow Productivity by Cal Newport: An analysis on the frantic busyness of knowledge workplaces and an alternative paradigm that yields high quality results and is simultaneously fulfilling.
- Leaders Eat Last by Simon Sinek: Creating environments where employees feel valued, supported and motivated to be at their best.
- Supercommunicators by Charles Duhigg: A study of supercommunicators and a resulting recipe for effective communication.
- Switch by Chip and Dan Heath: A story-driven narrative that presents an almost formulaic way of successful change management.
- Talking to Humans by Frank Rimalovski and Giff Constable: Sort of a manual on customer discovery and development.
- The Cult of We by Eliot Brown and Maureen Farrell: A gripping narrative of the rise and fall of WeWork and the crazy world of venture capital and fundraising.
- Hit Refresh by Satya Nadella: A very interesting read on Satya's approach to causing a big shift in culture and thought in a massive organization, Microsoft.
- Crossing the Chasm by Geoffery Moore: The bible on taking a high-tech product to market. Many other books on marketing, entrepreneurship and customer discovery reference this book for a reason.
- The Culture Map by Erin Meyer: A book that builds critical perspective for anyone faced with interacting with people across cultures.
- Flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi: A psychologist's study on the state of mind that brings fulfillment.
