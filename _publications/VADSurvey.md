## Abstract

This survey article summarizes research trends on the topic of anomaly detection in video feeds of a single scene. We discuss the various problem formulations, publicly available datasets and evaluation criteria. We categorize and situate past research into an intuitive taxonomy and provide a comprehensive comparison of the accuracy of many algorithms on standard test sets. Finally, we also provide best practices and suggest some possible directions for future research.
