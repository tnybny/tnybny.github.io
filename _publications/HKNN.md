## Abstract

Monitoring biomass over large geographic regions for changes in vegetation and cropping patterns is important for many applications. Changes in vegetation happen due to reasons ranging from climate change and damages to new government policies and regulations. Remote sensing imagery (multi-spectral and multi-temporal) is widely used in change pattern mapping studies. Existing bi-temporal change detection techniques are better suited for multi-spectral images and time series based techniques are more suited for analyzing multi-temporal images. A key contribution of this work is to define change as hierarchical rather than boolean. Based on this definition of change pattern, we developed a novel time series similarity based change detection framework for identifying inter-annual changes by exploiting phenological properties of growing crops from satellite time series imagery. The proposed framework consists of three components: hierarchical clustering tree construction, nearest neighbor based classification, and change detection using similarity hierarchy. Though the proposed approach is unsupervised, we present evaluation using manually induced change regions embedded in the real dataset. We compare our method with the widely used K-Means clustering and evaluation shows that K-Means over-detects changes in comparison to our proposed method.
