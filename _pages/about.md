I am a Machine Learning Scientist at Invision AI. Here, I work on developing several computer vision and machine learning systems for industrial applications. Previously, I worked on top-down 3D pose estimation as well as fully-differentiable bottom-up pose parsing using transformer networks at wrnch AI in Montreal. I have a Ph.D. from the Computer Science department at North Carolina State University and my dissertation was titled "Anomaly Detection in Videos". I was advised by Ranga Raju Vatsavai and also worked actively with Mike Jones at Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories. My research interests revolve around machine learning and computer vision and I typically like to have one hand in foundational ML research and another in applied CV research. 

In my own time, I'm looking to explore unsupervised representation learning with deep generative models and out-of-distribution generalization for anomaly detection. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about anything from climbing or soccer to questions about Invision AI to research collaboration.
