I am a Senior Research Scientist at [Geopipe](https://geopi.pe/#). I would describe myself as a researcher and a leader. I love making connections in deep research topics related to machine learning and deep learning and relating them to product visions and business decisions. I also enjoy dealing with the complexity that is the human condition, and primarly do this by speaking directly and from the heart. I am honored to have been named an [Emerging Leader in AI in Cananda](https://readthepeak.com/lists/emerging-leaders-2022/c/artificial-intelligence) in 2022.

Previously, I was the lead Machine Learning Scientist at [Invision AI](https://invision.ai/) in Toronto where I led and grew a machine learning team to develop algorithms for use in smart infrastructure technologies such as object detection, knowledge distillation, federated learning and multitask loss optimization among others. Prior to that, I've worked on top-down 3D human pose estimation as well as fully-differentiable bottom-up pose parsing using transformer networks at wrnch AI in Montr√©al which was acquired by [Hinge Health](https://www.hingehealth.com/). I have also contributed to and consulted in applied and foundational topics ranging semi-supervised learning, knowledge distillation, shape estimation, neural inverse kinematics, video anomaly detection, multi-modal learning, video action recognition, person re-identification and adversarial learning.

I have a Ph.D. from the Computer Science department at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/) and my dissertation was titled "Anomaly Detection in Videos". I was advised by [Ranga Raju Vatsavai](https://rvatsavai.github.io/) and also worked actively with [Mike Jones](https://www.merl.com/people/mjones) at [Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories](https://merl.com/).

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about anything from Geopipe, research collaboration, or consulting inquiries.
