I am a doctoral candidate with the Computer Science department at North Carolina State University, advised by Ranga Raju Vatsavai. I also work actively with Mike Jones at Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories. My research interests revolve around machine learning and computer vision and I typically like to have one hand in foundational ML research and another in applied CV research. I envision my doctoral thesis being about anomaly detection in video datasets.  

I'm looking to continue research after graduation in unsupervised representation learning with deep generative models and out-of-domain generalization for anomaly detection.
