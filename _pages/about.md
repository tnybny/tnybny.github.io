I am a doctoral candidate with the Computer Science department at North Carolina State University, advised by Dr. Ranga Raju Vatsavai. I also work actively with Mike Jones at Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories. My research interests revolve around machine learning and computer vision and I typically like to have one hand in foundational ML research and another in applied CV research. A recent fascination has been with unsupervised representation learning and how out-of-domain inputs are dealt with for anomaly detection. I envision my doctoral thesis being about anomaly detection in video datasets.
