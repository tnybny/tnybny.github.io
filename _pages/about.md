I am the lead Machine Learning Scientist at Invision AI. Here, I'm leading and growing a machine learning team to develop computer vision and machine learning systems for use in emerging technologies in smart cities. I also consult on both a technical level and on building high-performing AI/ML teams. 

Previously, I've worked on top-down 3D human pose estimation as well as fully-differentiable bottom-up pose parsing using transformer networks at wrnch AI in Montreal which was acquired by Hinge Health. I have also contributed to and consulted in applied and foundational topics ranging semi-supervised learning, knowledge distillation, shape estimation, neural inverse kinematics, video anomaly detection, multi-modal learning, video action recognition, person re-identification and adversarial learning.

I have a Ph.D. from the Computer Science department at North Carolina State University and my dissertation was titled "Anomaly Detection in Videos". I was advised by Ranga Raju Vatsavai and also worked actively with Mike Jones at Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about anything from questions about Invision AI, research collaboration, or consulting queries.
