I am a Computer Vision Scientist at Wrnch AI in Montreal. Here, I work on 3D pose estimation. I graduated with a Ph.D. from the Computer Science department at North Carolina State University with a dissertation titled "Anomaly Detection in Videos". I was advised by Ranga Raju Vatsavai and also worked actively with Mike Jones at Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories. My research interests revolve around machine learning and computer vision and I typically like to have one hand in foundational ML research and another in applied CV research. 

In my own time, I'm looking to explore unsupervised representation learning with deep generative models and out-of-distribution generalization for anomaly detection. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about anything from climbing or soccer to questions about Wrnch to research collaboration.
