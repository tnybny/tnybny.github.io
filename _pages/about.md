I am an applied research leader in machine learning and computer vision. 
I have repeatedly guided teams out of dysfunction and to realize a well-oiled, high-performing and enjoyable work environment, all while building deep tech products. 
Further, I enjoy making connections in applied research topics related to machine learning and deep learning, and relating them to product visions. 
In 2022, I was named an [Emerging Leader in AI in Canada](https://readthepeak.com/lists/emerging-leaders-2022/c/artificial-intelligence), before I moved (back) to the United States.

I am a Staff Software Engineer with the Perception team at [Stack](https://stackav.com/). 
Here, I develop deep learning based systems that enable our autnomous trucks to sense the world around them. 
Previously, I was Head of Machine Learning at [Geopipe](https://www.geopipe.ai/), which was acquired by [NBCUniversal](https://www.nbcuniversal.com/) in NYC where I led the team responsible for developing deep learning models to perform 3D reconstruction of digital twin cities from orthophotos and LiDAR data. 
Prior to that, I was Team Lead and Scientist of the Machine Learning team at [Invision AI](https://invision.ai/) in Toronto where I supervised and grew a machine learning team to develop algorithms for use in smart infrastructure technologies such as object detection, knowledge distillation, federated learning and multitask loss optimization among others. 
Prior to that, as a Computer Vision Scientist I worked on top-down 3D human pose estimation as well as fully-differentiable bottom-up pose parsing using transformer networks at [wrnch AI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wrnch/?originalSubdomain=ca) in Montr√©al which was acquired by [Hinge Health](https://www.hingehealth.com/). 
I have also contributed to and consulted in applied and foundational topics ranging semi-supervised learning, knowledge distillation, shape estimation, neural inverse kinematics, video anomaly detection, multi-modal learning, video action recognition, person re-identification and adversarial learning.

I have a Ph.D. from the Computer Science department at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/) and my dissertation was titled "Anomaly Detection in Videos". 
I was advised by [Ranga Raju Vatsavai](https://rvatsavai.github.io/) and also worked actively with [Mike Jones](https://www.merl.com/people/mjones) at [Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories](https://merl.com/).
