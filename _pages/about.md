I recently graduated with a Ph.D. from the Computer Science department at North Carolina State University with a dissertation titled "Anomaly Detection in Videos". I was advised by Ranga Raju Vatsavai and also worked actively with Mike Jones at Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories. My research interests revolve around machine learning and computer vision and I typically like to have one hand in foundational ML research and another in applied CV research. 

I'm going to be joining Wrnch.AI in Montreal as a Computer Vision in Jan 2020. In my own time, I'm looking to explore unsupervised representation learning with deep generative models and out-of-distribution generalization for anomaly detection. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about anything from climbing or soccer to questions about Wrnch to research collaboration.
