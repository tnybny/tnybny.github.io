I am a doctoral candidate with the Computer Science department at North Carolina State University, advised by Dr. Ranga Raju Vatsavai. My research interests revolve around machine learning and computer vision. I typically like to have one hand in foundational ML research and another in applied CV research. I am currently engaged with exploring new methods for anomaly detection and localization in videos. A recent fascination is also with generative methods and unsupervised learning and their relation to VAEs, GANs and anomaly detection. I envision my doctoral thesis being about anomaly detection in video datasets.
